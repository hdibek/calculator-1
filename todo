* Try to figure out how to dynamically alter the limit on operand final length depending on current operand length (e.g., operand consists of 23 ones, and you could probably fit a non-one digit in at the end without overflowing the div, whereas any operand consisting of all non-one digits can only be a max of 23 digits long before overflowing the div).

* Now that operation output can be used as operation input, figure how to get output to clear upon entering a new operand, but not upon entering a new operator, directly after displaying output. (e.g., 6+2=8, +4=12; but, 6+2=8, 2+2=4; not 6+2=8, 82+2=84)

* Modify output so that it fits in the display? It's kind of already doing that with exponential notation output, though...
